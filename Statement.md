# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often struggle with efficient workforce management due to a reliance on manual paper records or disorganized spreadsheets. These methods are prone to human error, lack data persistence, and make retrieving specific employee details time-consuming and inefficient. There is a need for a lightweight, digital solution to automate record-keeping without the complexity and cost of enterprise-grade software.

## Scope of the Project
The **Employee Management System** is a desktop-based console application designed to digitize basic HR operations.
* **Domain:** Human Resource Management / Database Management.
* **Platform:** Standalone Python Application (Command Line Interface).
* **Data Storage:** Local File System (CSV) for portability and simplicity.
* **Constraint:** The system is designed for single-user access and handles standard textual and numerical data types.

## Target Users
* **HR Administrators:** For maintaining up-to-date staff records.
* **Small Business Owners:** To track salary and employee details without purchasing expensive software.
* **Department Managers:** For quick lookup of team member information during reviews.

## High-Level Features
* **Employee Registration:** Securely add new personnel with unique identifiers.
* **Data Retrieval:** Instant access to employee records via a linear search function.
* **Record Maintenance:** Ability to update salary or name details as they change.
* **Data Removal:** Functionality to permanently delete records of former employees.
* **Persistent Storage:** Automatic saving of data to ensure reliability across system restarts.
